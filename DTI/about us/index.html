            <h1>SheSecure Emergency System</h1>
            <p>SheSecure Emergency System is the vision of Govt. of India to launch an integrated
                emergency response system with a single emergency number 112, to address different emergencies of
                citizens. It is designed to address all emergency signals received from citizens through voice call,
                SMS, e-mail, panic SOS signal, ERSS web portal etc. <br>
                A mobile App called ‘112 India’ is introduced by Govt. of India, to quickly raise a request for help
                when
                a person is in emergency, by pressing a button to send alert messages with location data and make
                emergency call to 112. This facility will aid the concerned service agencies to reach out the requestor
                quickly. <br>
                The automated facility being setup for this purpose in the capital cities of all States and UTs, called
                Public Safety Answering Point (PSAP), will handle all these emergency signals and provide assistance
                available to the people in distress within the best possible time with the help of Police, Fire &
                Rescue, Health services etc.</p>
